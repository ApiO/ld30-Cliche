**WHAT IS PGTECH ?**

Personal 2D/3D game engine with its tools suite. Everything is written in c++ (c-style). Published really soon with a friendly open source license üòâ
 

## Postmortem

This game isn‚Äôt finished. It is ‚Äúplayable‚Äù but there is no end and monsters can‚Äôt be killed. 
This must be the shitiest submission ever done but I had to. By respect for my girlfriend to let me participate despite our busy weeked and for the work done (graphics!). 

At first I tried to simply focus myself on a classic WTF game but I quickly bored myself turning around with stereotypes. When suddenly I found The thing, a game, with only cliche !

**Why I failed ?**

The project was too ambitious and with less than 10h of work, according to my actual skills, I could not hope for a better result.

I will do the next LD more seriously.

In fact I‚Äôm pretty happy to have experienced all of the pgtech workflow. It was a good test.

In an enhanced version I will add some laser beams and T-Rex. And maybe animations, sounds ‚Ä¶ and feedbacks and ‚Ä¶ dammit !
